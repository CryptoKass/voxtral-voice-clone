## Model Overview

| Component | Params | Role |
|-----------|--------|------|
| LLM Backbone (Ministral-3B) | ~3.4B | Text + voice conditioning -> semantic tokens |
| Acoustic Transformer | ~390M | Semantic -> acoustic tokens (flow-matching) |
| Codec Encoder | ~149M | Audio -> discrete codes (**trained by this project**) |
| Codec Decoder | ~149M | Codes -> audio waveform |
| Quantizer (VQ-FSQ) | ~2M | Continuous -> discrete codes |
| Audio Token Embedding | ~28M | Codes -> 3072-dim LLM embeddings |

## Codec Encoder (149M params, 114 weight tensors)

4-stage conv-transformer encoder following the paper specification:

- Input: raw audio `[B, 1, T]` at 24kHz
- Patch size: 240 samples (10ms)
- Hidden dim: 1024, FFN dim: 4096, head dim: 128
- 8 attention heads, 8 KV heads, QK norm, ALiBi positional bias, causal
- Sliding window attention: 16 -> 8 -> 4 -> 2 (halved at each downsampling)
- LayerScale initialized at 0.01
- Output: `[B, 292, L]` latent (256 semantic + 36 acoustic dims)
- Downsampling: strides (2,2,2,1) -> 8x temporal compression
- Frame rate: 24000 / (240 x 8) = 12.5 Hz

### Encoder Structure

```
input_proj (CausalConv1d):         240 -> 1024, kernel=7, weight_norm
encoder_blocks.0 (Transformer):    2 layers, window=16
encoder_blocks.1 (CausalConv1d):   1024 -> 1024, kernel=4, stride=2
encoder_blocks.2 (Transformer):    2 layers, window=8
encoder_blocks.3 (CausalConv1d):   1024 -> 1024, kernel=4, stride=2
encoder_blocks.4 (Transformer):    2 layers, window=4
encoder_blocks.5 (CausalConv1d):   1024 -> 1024, kernel=4, stride=2
encoder_blocks.6 (Transformer):    2 layers, window=2
encoder_blocks.7 (CausalConv1d):   1024 -> 292, kernel=3, stride=1
```

## Quantizer (VQ-FSQ Hybrid)

The 292-dim latent is split and quantized independently:

- **Semantic** (dims 0-255): VQ codebook, 8192 entries x 256 dims
  - Euclidean distance nearest-neighbor lookup
  - During training: applied with 50% probability (50% passthrough)
  - ASR-distilled from Whisper for phoneme content

- **Acoustic** (dims 256-291): FSQ, 21 levels x 36 channels
  - `tanh` bounding -> uniform quantization to 21 levels
  - During training: 50% quantize, 25% dither, 25% passthrough

Total: 37 codes per frame (1 semantic + 36 acoustic)
Bitrate: 12.5 Hz x (log2(8192) + 36 x log2(21)) = 2.14 kbps

### Embedding Table Layout

The audio token embedding `[9088, 3072]` maps codes to LLM space:
- Codebook 0 (semantic): offset=0, size=8194 (8192 + 2 special tokens)
- Codebook 1-36 (acoustic): offset=8194+k*23, size=23 each (21 + 2 special)

Voice embedding per frame = **sum of 37 lookups** from this table.

## LLM Backbone (Ministral-3B, 26 layers)

- hidden_dim = 3072, n_heads = 32, n_kv_heads = 8, head_dim = 128
- FFN: SwiGLU, hidden = 9216
- RoPE: theta = 1,000,000
- vocab_size = 131,072

### Prompt Structure

```
[BOS=1] [BEGIN_AUDIO=25] [AUDIO=24 x N] [text tokens...] [END=25]
```

Voice reference tokens come first, then text. Audio token positions are
replaced by voice embeddings (sum of 37 codebook lookups per frame).

## Training Recipe (from paper)

### Codec Training
```
L = alpha * L_feature + beta * L_ASR + gamma^t * L_L1 + gamma^t * L_STFT + delta * L_commit
```
Where alpha=1.0, beta=1.0, gamma=0.9999^t (exponential decay), delta=0.1.

### Key Training Details
- Discriminator: 8 multi-resolution STFT discriminators
- Feature matching loss is the primary reconstruction signal
- L1/STFT losses decay as discriminator strengthens
- Text embeddings are frozen during LLM training
- LLM backbone initialized from Ministral-3B

## Research Findings

### What Was Missing from the Open-Weight Release
The codec encoder weights were deliberately stripped from the checkpoint.
The architecture is fully specified in the serving framework, and the decoder +
quantizer weights are included. Only the encoder weights need to be trained.

### Key Discoveries

**Binary code saturation**: Without the paper's stochastic quantization schedule
(50/25/25 for acoustic, 50% for semantic), the encoder produces only extreme
codes (0 and 20). The stochastic schedule teaches intermediate values naturally.

**Semantic codebook collapse**: Without ASR distillation from Whisper, all encoder
outputs map to the same semantic codebook entry. The Whisper cosine loss provides
the linguistic content supervision needed for semantic diversity. However, ASR
distillation alone is insufficient -- the encoder's outputs can be diverse in
continuous space while still mapping to the same VQ entry (they all land in one
Voronoi cell of the frozen codebook). A **codebook diversity loss** based on the
entropy of soft assignments to codebook entries is needed to explicitly spread
encoder outputs across the codebook geometry. This combination (ASR + diversity)
broke the collapse from sem_util=1/8192 to 100+/8192 within 500 training steps.

**Voice identity is the LLM's job**: The codec encoder should focus purely on
reconstruction quality. Voice identity emerges during LLM training where it
processes (voice_reference, text) -> audio pairs. Attempts to add voice identity
losses to the encoder training are counterproductive.

**Preset embedding structure**: Voice embeddings are sums of 37 codebook lookups.
Preset-to-preset cosine similarity is very high (0.97-0.99). The LLM distinguishes
voices based on 2-3% cosine differences.

### Training Pipeline

1. **Phase 1 - Encoder**: Train codec encoder with reconstruction + ASR distillation + codebook diversity + discriminator
2. **Phase 2 - LoRA**: Fine-tune the LLM with LoRA to interpret our encoder's code patterns
3. **Phase 3 (optional)**: DPO post-training for improved speaker similarity
